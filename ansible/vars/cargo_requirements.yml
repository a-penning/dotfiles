# Library-style crates or projects that do not publish binaries to crates.io.
# These will be handled separately (e.g. installed from a git repo or built differently).
# Each entry should provide:
#  - name: friendly name (optional)
#  - git: repository URL (required for git installs)
#  - bin: the binary target name to install (optional; falls back to `name`)
#  - binary: the expected installed binary name (used for `creates`)
